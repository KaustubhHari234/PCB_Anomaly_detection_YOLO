PCB Anomaly Detection using YOLOv8

Overview

This repository presents a PCB anomaly detection system leveraging the powerful YOLOv8 object detection framework. 
The system is designed to identify and localize defects or abnormalities on printed circuit boards (PCBs).

Dataset Preparation

Image collection: Gather a diverse dataset of PCB images, including both normal and defective samples.
Annotation: Annotate the defects in the images using a suitable annotation tool (e.g., LabelImg).
Data splitting: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Model Training

Configure training parameters: Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
Start training: Run the training script, specifying the dataset path and configuration file.
Monitor training: Track the training progress using tensorboard or other visualization tools.
Model Evaluation

Evaluate performance: Use metrics like precision, recall, and mAP to assess the model's accuracy.
Visualize predictions: Visualize the model's predictions on test images to gain insights into its performance.
Deployment

Export the model: Convert the trained model to a suitable format for deployment (e.g., ONNX, CoreML).
Integrate with applications: Deploy the model into production systems, such as quality inspection systems or manufacturing lines.
Additional Considerations

Data augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.
Transfer learning: Leverage pre-trained YOLOv8 models to accelerate training and improve performance.
Model optimization: Optimize the model for deployment on edge devices or resource-constrained systems.
Continuous improvement: Regularly update and refine the model to improve its accuracy and efficiency.
